	<h2 class="title">Share Market Astrology Chart- what is it?</h2>
	<p>
		A birth (natal) chart shows the location of celestial bodies at the time of birth and their
		cosmic influences. Your date of birth contains key information about all aspects of life,
		including the investment. By studying the elements of your birth chart, you can determine how
		likely you are to succeed in stock trading.

	<h3>Real-World Examples of Astrology in Trading</h3>
	<p>
		The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which is one of the 12 regional banks that collectively
		form the Federal Reserve System, has conducted a number of studies on the topic. The results of
		the studies showed a direct link between geomagnetic storms and stock market declines. A second
		study conducted by The Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (NYSE: RBS) once again proved that a
		trading system based on the lunar cycle can indeed benefit investors in the market.
	</p>
	<h3>The Role of Planetary Location</h3>
	<p>
		Experts closely monitor the positions of specific planets, as these are thought to sway trading
		and financial results. Let’s take a closer look at two key planets and their supposed impact on
		the markets:

				Mercury: Dubbed the planet of communication and intellect, Mercury's placement plays a
				pivotal role in discerning trends and shaping sound trading decisions. It's tied to the
				analytical side of trading, affecting how traders think, strategize, and communicate within
				the financial markets.
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div class="li-bullet"></div>
			<div class="li-content">
				Jupiter: Known as the planet of wealth and prosperity, Jupiter’s influence is deemed crucial

	<h3>Astrological Factors to Consider in Share Trading</h3>
	<p>
		Vedic astrology suggests several celestial factors that might influence the financial sector:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Planetary Transits</strong>: Jupiter and Saturn influence economic cycles and market
			moods.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Lunar Phases</strong>: New and full moons can increase market volatility due to
			emotional responses.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Eclipses</strong>: Solar and lunar eclipses may trigger significant market movements.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Planetary Aspects</strong>: Conjunctions, squares, and oppositions can indicate
			potential market shifts.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<a href={$MAIN_LINK} class="button">Astrology in share market</a>

	<h2 class="title">Astrology Tips for Success</h2>
	<p>Key yogas for success include:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>The ruler of the 7th house in the Ascendant, 2nd, or 11th house.</li>
		<li>Saturn in Libra, Capricorn, or Aquarius, or holding significant power.</li>
		<li>Conjunction of Venus and Saturn in key positions.</li>
		<li>Exchange between Venus and Saturn.</li>
		<li>No 6-8 relationship between Saturn and Venus.</li>
		<li>Strong Saturn and Moon with good aspects.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		If the native fulfils all the above conditions, they can achieve significant success in the
		business. If only one condition is met, moderate success may be attained. Understand the
		dynamics of the share market according to astrology to optimise your investment decisions.

	<p>
		We are used to using charts and indicators to determine trends and possible changes in the
		direction of the price chart. At the same time, analyses can indicate key dates and periods of
		increased volatility based on planetary locations such as Mercury retrograde or significant
		lunar phases.
